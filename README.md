You Must **Change SMBIOS** to use **iCloud Services**,Select MacBookPro16,2 for smbios model

It is not recommended to use opencore to boot win, it is recommended to set efi/refind/refind_x64.efi as the first boot, then you can use refind to start win and Mac normally

config.plist is applicable to unlocked cfg and dvmt, config-lockCFG.plist is used without unlocking cfg and dvmt, see below for unlocking tutorial

Simplify and compile bluetooth, wifi and sound card according to the source code, only support local use, thanks to the author and everyone

Currently working on my Personal Machine, so only **stable versions** will be released

#### Compatible macOS Versions:
big sur   Monterey    Ventura

<strong>macOS Ventura Support Completed, Will keep maintaining</strong></summary>

## Introduction

This repo contains the files needed for getting macOS working on a **Huawei MateBook X Pro (2020 Edition)** laptop with OpenCore.
* This is intended to create a "fully" functional (as far as possible) hackintosh for the Huawei Matebook X Pro.
* The project can be considered **stable**.
* With each new release of macOS we need to resolve each new "minor issue" we run into. 
* If you would like to get started with creating a hackintosh on your MBXP but have non experience, I would highly recommend following [**Dortania's OpenCore Install guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and then returning here for troubleshooting or last improvements.


### Summary

- The **compatibility** is **very good** for the most part, most of the stuff works like it would on a real MacBook, including camera, audio, touchpad, iCloud services.
- The **experience** is **pleasant**, as the laptop is smooth and responsive under macOS Big Sur/Catalina/Ventura.
- **Battery life** is **quite great** (from personal experience it **lasts from 4-6 hours** for light works depending on its age with a behaviour very similar to Windows 11.

(With the use of turbo boost disabled)

- The **Intel WiFi** card is soldered onto the motherboard, which means it can't be replaced with a Broadcom one, but the Intel card is now **functional albeit not operating at full speeds** (however it is fine for most use cases).
    * With the latest `AirportItlwm.kext` even **Handoff** and **Continuity** features are working, but with a very limited support for AirDrop and Apple Watch unlocking (see [Changelog for OpenIntelWireless release](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)).
    * For any issues about `AirportItlwm.kext` please refer first to [**OpenIntelWireless Troubleshooting page**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/Troubleshooting.html#kernel-extension-loading-status) and then to [**OpenIntelWireless Gitter Page**](https://gitter.im/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)


### Generate your own SMBIOS Information

For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. You need to generate your unique `SMBIOS` info by yourself (recommend to use [**CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)), and inject them into your `config.plist`.
- With every **EFI update** you retrieve from here, please, remember to transfer **your Device details** under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` in your `config.plist`.

## Note From espitgn:

There is the possibility of disabling CFG Lock and enabling dvmt 64. There is a power management improvement disabling CFG Lock which is quite good. The procedure (Customising BIOS) is quite easy to follow. 

About unlocking cfg and dvmt
‚ö†Ô∏èNote: After changing the data, close the software and verify that it is correct before changing the dmvt. When you modify it at the same time for personal testing, the second one will not be saved.
Unzip InsydeH2OUVE_x86_WINx64_200.00.01.00.zip and open the software, file-load runtime in the upper left corner, double-click Variable in the left column,
Find cpusetup and double-click, search for 0030 vertically, 0E horizontally, the original value 01, change it to 00, then put a check mark in front of cpusetup, click the purple save icon in the upper left corner, and verify whether the value is still 00 after restarting, cfg Unlocked successfully

Unlock dmvt, file-load runtime in the upper left corner, double-click Variable in the left column,
Find SaSetup and double-click, search for 0100 vertically, 07 horizontally, the original value is 01, and change it to 02. Then search for 0100 vertically, 08 horizontally, the original value 02, change it to 03, then tick Sasetup, click the purple save icon in the upper left corner, and verify whether the values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãare 02 and 03 after restarting, the dmvt is unlocked successfully

I recommend using ‚ÄúInsydeH2OUVE‚Äù to modify dvmt and unlock cfg

These guides work without issue on the MateBook X Pro 2020 (tested with BIOS 1.21 versions). 

Each guide shows the changes to do in config.plist as well.
	
### Fixing Sleep (taken from Profzei):

Open up terminal and make the following changes:

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm -rf /private/var/vm/sleepimage
sudo touch /private/var/vm/sleepimage
sudo chflags uchg /private/var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
```
### Headphone Hot Plug:
Install [ALCPlugFix](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/tree/master/ALCPlugFix)

Many great people.
